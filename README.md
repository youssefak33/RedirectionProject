<h1>RedirectionProject</h1>
<p>RedirectionProject is a web application developed in PHP following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. It enables users to create custom redirect URLs, facilitating the tracking of links from external sources such as Google Drive documents, SharePoint, or other similar platforms.
